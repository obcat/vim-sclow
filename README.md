# vim-sclow

Text-based scrollbar for Vim.

![sclow eyecatch](https://i.gyazo.com/0e141446f04bf34ecdd3e55ee439a291.gif)


## Installation

Requires Vim compiled with `+popupwin` feature (Neovim is not supported).

If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add the following
line to your vimrc:

```vim
Plug 'obcat/vim-sclow'
```

You can use any other plugin manager.


## Usage

No settings are required. A scrollbar will automatically appear on the right
edge of the current window.


### Tip

As you **move the cursor** and scroll, the scrollbar's position will be updated
immediately.

On the other hand, if you scroll **without moving the cursor** (you can do this
with `<C-e>` or `<C-y>` etc.), the scrollbar's position will be updated after
the time specified with the `updatetime` option.

The default value of `updatetime` is `4000`, i.e. 4 seconds. If you want to
update the scrollbar's position as soon as possible, reduce the value of this
option. I suggest around 100ms:

```vim
set updatetime=100
```

Note that `updatetime` also controls the delay before Vim writes its swap file
(see `:h updatetime`).


## Customization

You can customize some features.


### Appearance

To customize scrollbar's appearance, you can use:

* `g:sclow_sbar_text` (default: `"\<Space>"`)
* `SclowSbar` highlight group (default: links to `Pmenu`)

Examples:

```vim
let g:sclow_sbar_text = '*'
highlight link SclowSbar PmenuSel
```

```vim
let g:sclow_sbar_text = 'üëæüëæ'
highlight SclowSbar ctermbg=NONE guibg=NONE
```

üìù I use [iceberg.vim](https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim) for color scheme.

You can also customize the offset of the scrollbar from the right border of the
window with `g:sclow_bar_right_offset` (default: `0`). Setting this to `-1`
helps to prevent the scrollbar from hiding the rightmost characters of the
window.

### Blocking

To disable scrollbar in a specific buffer, you can use:

* `g:sclow_block_filetypes` (default: `[]`)
* `g:sclow_block_buftypes` (default: `[]`)

Example:

```vim
let g:sclow_block_filetypes = ['netrw', 'nerdtree']
let g:sclow_block_buftypes = ['terminal', 'prompt']
```


### Hiding

By default, when both the first and last line of the buffer are in the window,
a full-length scrollbar will be shown.

If you want to hide this, use the following:

```vim
let g:sclow_hide_full_length = 1
```

See help file for more information.

### Autohiding

By default the scrollbar will be shown on the screen permanently. If this behavior
is undesirable, it is possible to automatically hide the scrollbar after a predefined
period of inactivity.

To make scrollbar disappear after 2000ms set:

```vim
let g:sclow_auto_hide = 2000
```
